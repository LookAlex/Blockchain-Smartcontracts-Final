CSC 299: Sophomore Lab in Applied Computing
In this course, students investigate a particular application of computing. Students learn tools, methodologies, and formalisms used in a particular computing area, and apply them to develop working systems. Courses stress student initiative in investigating the application context, learning new tools (including languages and APIs), studying algorithms and code examples, and working on projects. Topics will vary by the faculty member's interest and perspective.
This includes final project for a class using HTML, CSS, and Javascript using the services of Metamask to help build this project. Need a local host to run this program now.
